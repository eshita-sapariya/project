        The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy
        and sell crypto on its platform. After rolling out the ability to buy
        and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally
        allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive
        digital assets between PayPal other wallets and exchanges.As of Tuesday,
        the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature
        expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first
        batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin BTC $16,704, Ether ETH
        $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58. Crypto transfers
        to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their
        respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not
        incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new
        recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal
        will also not charge fees for incoming transfers, The company is also
        working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as
        central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is
        also exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed
        "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of
        such a stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone app.
