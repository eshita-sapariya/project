        Mango Markets Exploiter Eisenberg Arrested in Puerto Rico

        The investor drained $110 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform.
        Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose 'highly profitable trading
        strategy' drained DeFi trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth
        $110 million, was arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents said.
        The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango
        Markets' treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now
        be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating
        a decentralized-finance trading platform. Eisenberg faces charges of
        commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a filing
        unsealed Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines
        to prison time. A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz
        alleges Eisenberg 'willfully and knowingly' manipulated the sale of a
        commodity - namely futures contracts on Mango Markets. 'Eisenberg
        engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial
        manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a
        cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and
        deceptive devices and contrivances.'
